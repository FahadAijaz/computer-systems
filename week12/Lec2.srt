00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
Ok for those two are watching the recording of the reason I'm not saying anything is because we're busy filling the

5
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
If you'd like to fill in the SES yourself while you're waiting for the recording to that starts

6
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
Go for it now otherwise you fast forward until I move slide off this one onto the next one

7
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
Just out of interest how many people are still feeling in the SES at the moment perfect I'll give you another file so minutes

8
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
OK how many people still feeling in the SES

9
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:06,175
That's perfect ok

10
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:12,575
Today is just revision with both dunhelen me before we revised

11
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,975
122 hours long

12
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,023
One Mark per minute

13
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:27,423
Three parts first multiple choice

14
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:33,823
What size should be 10?

15
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
7 and then 9

16
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
6 to 12 bucks no face

17
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:55,327
Will be covering material from both of the subject

18
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:59,935
Because the mid-semester test carrying some of the mark for it

19
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:06,591
I don't expect you to read this but those what is zoom in this is what the front page will look like this explained

20
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,639
Change the format of everything

21
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Ok so first well I'm going to revise what we've done in the second half

22
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:22,207
Revise what was done in the first half

23
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:29,375
Ok the first thing we started off with was The Cure communications transport layer security

24
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:35,775
We looked at a cheese we looked a little bit of Howard achieve

25
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Some bits of cryptography in their transport security

26
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,711
At the start

27
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:50,111
Will you negotiate the cryptography of the system going to be using throughout the rest of the

28
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:56,511
The section a little bit

29
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:01,631
But it's made look as it is so that makes it

30
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
We look at some of the nuts and bolts of

31
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Symmetric vs asymmetric code example symmetric is the

32
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
Encryption standard

33
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
Will there be a couple of modes of operation and then we look at an asymmetric version

34
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:30,559
RSA and we saw how they can be used for authentication of signatures and the really important forward to

35
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:43,103
Yep good internet layer

36
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,039
A datagram service

37
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
All of the different properties that has

38
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:04,863
Quality of service what do we mean by quality of service

39
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,727
How to achieve quality of service why doesn't everybody have good quality of service

40
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:16,127
Typically include

41
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:22,527
Or the day to achieve for the packet loss rate any measure of

42
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,295
Performance

43
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
I will look at the fact the big part of the problem comes because the Internet is a shared network

44
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:34,559
To give you a good quality of service

45
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959
Doesn't necessarily get paid any money for it and those cases we typically get just best effort

46
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,287
But within a company

47
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,823
You might

48
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,895
Be willing to pay for

49
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,687
Better quality of service

50
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
Contact mpls

51
00:08:55,039 --> 00:09:01,183
Locate the predominant networking technology at the moment is ipv4

52
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,511
What constitutes an ipv4 packet

53
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,143
And we spent a lot of time looking at what is an ipv4 address

54
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:14,495
And there a lot of people who are confused about missing you have any lol

55
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
Please ask questions

56
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,871
The address is divided into a network address

57
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
First remit

58
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,759
And then the host network for the last few bits

59
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
How many humans

60
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,367
That specified by the subnet mask

61
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,487
Written notation

62
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
But we can't necessarily say that some of these digits some of the decimal digits

63
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
The network

64
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Networking host is done

65
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:53,407
In the binary representation of this and that often appears in the middle of one of these

66
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
Blocks

67
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,807
We look at the factory this notion of something

68
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,879
Network address and host address

69
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:07,999
Limits to sizes networks

70
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Samsung consequences

71
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:21,823
Network you belong to because any given that work can be submited further into long layers

72
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Network

73
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,783
Hi can we also look at Network address translation for Network address and Port translation

74
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:37,695
It works it works by using one address on one side of the net box on a prime

75
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
I need a different address on the other side

76
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:47,679
And the fact that we have to

77
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
The number which we know which which

78
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
IP address

79
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
Real written onto it

80
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,575
Because I was running out of addresses

81
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,463
Are we saw that ipv6 is beginning to take hold and that has no shortage of addresses

82
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
But that is likely to say around

83
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,327
Because it has other benefits

84
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
As well as big disadvantages one clear benefit is

85
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Security

86
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,799
Because that is about as well

87
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
But nice thing about Nat is it allows independent if you have an address from ISP on the other

88
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:39,903
Network speed to put a new appliance in

89
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:43,999
Ok we also look at packet fragmentation

90
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Packets fragmentation happens when we send a packet is too big for one of the hops on the

91
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,727
What are the point to point links on the network

92
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:58,591
We can break down them

93
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,407
Ipv4

94
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
Ipv6

95
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,223
We can't

96
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:10,623
Fragmentation too much hassle the host to work out how big

97
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:16,511
Big teddy for that we need to have path-mtu-discovery

98
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
And that is also widely used in ipv4 even though fragmentation is in principle possible

99
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:33,151
Ok lol that's looking at things

100
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,943
Very general network

101
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,295
Problems to work out where

102
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
Send the packet

103
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:49,791
Rooting is the process of deciding that

104
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:57,215
Look up a table

105
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
And send the packet out

106
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Which is

107
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,015
Working out what that table should be in the first place

108
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,807
Calculating the routing table

109
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,439
Can we look at static routing adaptive routing flooding which is very inefficient

110
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:23,839
But effective and we spend a bit of time on shortest path algorithm where we view the network as a

111
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Labelled graph

112
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:31,263
What do I mean by label graph has a name each of the edges have a way

113
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,615
Wait on it and we can look at trying to find the path through this

114
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:38,943
Which minimises the sum of those egg weights

115
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
There is only really touched on dijkstra's algorithm I do understand

116
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,719
Turn headlights works and how to apply it

117
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
So he's a simple example of algorithm if we going from a to d

118
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
Open up

119
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,775
The neighbours of our

120
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,359
Open up the neighbours of a

121
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:14,015
Opening up memes

122
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
The cheapest of those

123
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:22,207
And then we say we're going to close it now and it's Neighbours

124
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:31,679
Ok and we stop when we get to the destination

125
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,007
Is the destination that's going to the shortest path to the destination

126
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,359
I take that back

127
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,199
As soon as we have closed the destination that's why we can stop

128
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:49,087
Ok shortest path algorithm typical used

129
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
Network within an autonomous system

130
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:59,839
Remember is that part of the network which is owned and run by a single entity

131
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,399
Don't have to worry about

132
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
Sharing information with themselves

133
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,871
But the internet is owned by a bunch of people

134
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,711
And each other

135
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:21,087
Anything about the internal networks

136
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:25,183
I don't want to tell anybody else

137
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,975
How my network is arranged

138
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:33,375
Soap bgp is the way routing between these entities don't trust

139
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,143
Which other

140
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
And it's a much more complicated

141
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,847
Range of

142
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,687
Effective and

143
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,111
The most important is who paid

144
00:15:55,391 --> 00:16:01,535
So we have this arrangement where is your a small ISP you contract out your work too

145
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:07,935
Does the hard work for you and that means you pay with

146
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:14,335
Directions

147
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:20,223
The time in Australia the link between Australia and America

148
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:32,511
Power here

149
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:38,911
Valley free roofing means we saw the valley free routines that we don't tend to

150
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,239
Amaroo to go up

151
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
And then down again and then up again and then down would never have one of these low it's near AIS is

152
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,687
Advertising groups

153
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Revenue for

154
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:58,623
You never tell someone to get somewhere through you unless you get a buck for doing it

155
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,023
And that means we never go up and down the advertised-routes 2 hour

156
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
Clients

157
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:13,471
Ok IP multicasting

158
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,823
It's ideal if you have an event that a lot of people are going to watch

159
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:26,527
Soccer streaming live conference

160
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,831
Call video

161
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:35,231
These are allocated a huge chunk of addresses call the class D addresses from the old class

162
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:37,791
System

163
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
And yes we can have lots of these groups

164
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
That's basically I need to say that

165
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
We spent quite a bit of time on medium access control the Mac sublayer

166
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:06,719
And we saw that we can have point-to-point links you plug in an ethernet cable that gives

167
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
Connection to another device you can have broadcast links you turn on your computer and the wife

168
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:19,263
Wi-Fi is talking to anyone who's in range and in the case of broadcast channels

169
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:26,175
How serious are my work carrier sense motorbikes it's carriers

170
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:28,479
Listen

171
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:35,135
You're welcome to transmit Alexis

172
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
We detect collisions

173
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Very efficient approach

174
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:44,351
But we can't do that in wireless so we have to use csma-ca instead

175
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
Multiple access with collision avoidance

176
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:55,359
Good we didn't really talk much about full and half duplex enough

177
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,175
Ok ethernet

178
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:03,807
Ethernet is the most widely used protocol that is called a link layer protocol

179
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,671
Or network layer

180
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
The classic version would you see a CD was clearly a link layer protocol

181
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,191
Point to point

182
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,591
No relation

183
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
To ethernet

184
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,647
Clear timer we said that was the old this is the new we migrated from having a single wire running around

185
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:46,047
Having a hump we all have a wire connected to it and then without the computer

186
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:49,119
Switch

187
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,775
Smooth migration from the original to the switch version

188
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
It WiFi we looked at a little bit about

189
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:09,087
Wi-Fi standards we looked at the idea of having multiple channels

190
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,695
Wi-Fi devices can choose from

191
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:19,839
But we really only use 3 of them because the rest of them have parcel overlaps with bad for us

192
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,495
Is Messi a very slightly about 11 security

193
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:34,687
OK what are the other tasks of the link layer

194
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:37,503
The Middle cast

195
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,575
How to get data from one point

196
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:46,975
To a slightly different point one hop along the way you need to make sure that you can work out how to get

197
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,839
Frames

198
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
Put the boundaries of the frame to the wrong spot

199
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,823
It's responsible for making sure that any errors that happened in the physical layer of which there are very very

200
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:08,223
Don't make it up to the next layer

201
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Baby pics of you along the way

202
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:18,208
And the fundamental role of the is flow control

203
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:24,608
This station is slow processing the data for some reason it needs to tell this other states

204
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,752
Listen to flow down it's ending not to send until the receiver has room store the new packet

205
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:38,688
Ok like the transport Layer 3 clear layers

206
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Frequent flyer can work in you can have an acknowledged connectilis service

207
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:53,792
Would you like to acknowledge connectionless service

208
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:58,144
Can you ask them to tell you I received it

209
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
But it's just a nice way to pack it's not part of a sequence and then you can have an acknowledged connection-oriented

210
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,312
Service

211
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
Good

212
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,880
A beacon of the access points and

213
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,768
I'm here

214
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
Ok to talk about stuff

215
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Operating systems

216
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,432
Attack

217
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
What is a pipeline

218
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:51,136
What does it mean when a pipeline stalls a pipeline you remember is when you have multiple

219
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Jacksons been executed simultaneously

220
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:03,936
The hardware store

221
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,984
Information missing for the next one

222
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,288
Speculative execution

223
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:12,128
What you don't know for certain what the next instruction will be

224
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
But you start executing one anyway

225
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,272
Throughout the results or get to keep them

226
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,416
Even though assembly language is a very low level language

227
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,536
Still there's a language below that within the hardware which is microcode

228
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,608
The two basic

229
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:39,008
The basic memory techniques used by CPUs which is used for

230
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,336
And registers which news for current working

231
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
Female cat

232
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
Memory management more broadly we look at how you can have multiple programs sharing memory

233
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:58,976
In particular swapping and the first entire memory

234
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
Footprint of one process take it out putting the next one

235
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,960
Using paging

236
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:16,128
If you willing to break down some of the functions that makes

237
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,528
Is it the memory if anything it wants to virtual memory

238
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,064
Everything is in memory

239
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:26,880
558 needs as it needs it

240
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:37,888
New computer data is effective going through a string you don't need to

241
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:42,240
Really in the next memory location or not

242
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Virtual memory the next part of a string is probably not in the next physical location of memory

243
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:55,296
Page

244
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,600
This is just contiguous memory

245
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:08,864
Perform This mapping using a page table

246
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:16,032
And the pace Abel says we're in memory eats actual location is

247
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:20,384
Which is what the program sees the memory is looking like

248
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,736
Ok all this operating system start stuff

249
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:30,112
To use is another aspect of the memory hierarchy which is case

250
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:36,000
Again we're getting the memory from is not

251
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:48,800
A copy a local copy which is very fast Traxxas

252
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:54,688
Level 2 level 3 and then we get virtual memory

253
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:59,040
Look at processes and threads

254
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:05,440
Most of the course were talking about processes we used to process was the endpoint

255
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,768
What actually is

256
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,840
He is a bunch of

257
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,752
Face got things like what is the memory the content of the memory

258
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:23,104
What is the process

259
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:28,480
A process for also have at least 13 of execution

260
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:33,344
Pets instructions being executed what happens next we have next

261
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:38,976
Execution can have multiple threads

262
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:51,776
And it has its own programs

263
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,544
Decode

264
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,896
We'll see look at the difference between

265
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:02,528
Different types of thread execution

266
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,088
Will use a code

267
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:09,184
Administrator or root code looked at the kernel

268
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,232
Increasing levels of priority

269
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:17,120
We need to switch from one to the other using system calls

270
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:23,520
Anytime you want to read data from a file read from the keyboard write to the network anything

271
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Can't be done directly by user process has to be done by a system call to the kernel

272
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:34,016
The privileges to do that

273
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:42,208
Ok that's all there is on second half

274
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:48,608
Ok hello everyone

275
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:55,008
That's not good with the content

276
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:55,776
Can't

277
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:02,432
You don't have to

278
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
Pay attention to what I'm saying here

279
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:15,232
Expected to know what is the Protocol and the strengths and drawbacks of delivery model

280
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
That's how it is here and internet applications

281
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:28,032
We have already taqaza four types of application layer protocols the first one is

282
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
Http FTP SMTP DNS

283
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,832
Teacher notes how do they work and what are they and how

284
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Communications between a fall for each of the following http

285
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632

286
00:28:53,888 --> 00:29:00,032
What kind of Hep A TCP connections will be insulated and

287
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:04,640
How many of technicians are related to independence of the connection

288
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
And for FTP you are you Maori

00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
Call Dad's each after command in the control connection how to how

290
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
Each commands work but then pulled up for loop commands are you

291
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
How many connections will be opened and how does that connect a connection

292
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,248
Work Pokemon

293
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
Hangouts 50 which is useful

294
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:56,096
Email then so you may let you know that's how I am where we wants to thank you email to

295
00:29:56,352 --> 00:30:02,496
Baba how to process work samples in Perth to make a email and answer put in

296
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
SMTP server and how does email to push through the output to the

297
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:15,296
SMTP service of Bob and then I can pop get this email from the server

298
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,064
Power

299
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,464
Alice all you need to know dad's up the format of the email message

300
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,864
And then some also know that the common Ponds difference between SMTP

301
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
EPL

302
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
You made it you know that

303
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:44,736
Dingo camper white and what's the difference between between them and how

304
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:49,600
How is the DNS server require kit work

305
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
And the second part of the first place recommend you focus on that

306
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,656

Multiplexing and demultiplexing

319
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
You need to understand what you said ok and what

331
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:28,832
Problems at the deciding.

Believe that you are very clear about this how does steep the communicator work

341
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:32,576
TCP full control you need to know that what is the purpose of purple control what is

342
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
The paper idea info control define and of course you also let you know that

343
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:43,328
How does the typing window protocol in TCP full control work

344
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
And finally in congestion control of course you also let you know them

345
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:56,640
The purpose of congestion control and how does a

346
00:34:56,896 --> 00:35:03,040

You may need to know that I'm different you may need to understand ok

356
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:57,056
At this time stands out what if the size of the congestion windows

357
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
I'm here in the 1800 mi mi.

358
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:09,856
Secondment on our rent standard drop down 2221

359
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:16,768
And also you let you know that somehow

360
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:23,168
How does the algorithms watch that switch between each other for example when when are the fast

361
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:29,568
Switch transmission event happens what will the algorithm spirit and then they how

362
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:34,176
How is the ratio of the congestion Windows is updated

363
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
Ok that's in the First

364
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
Rick and answer in the Indus what week are we also

365
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,888
How far from consolidation town specification time is the same as the letter time in the email

366
00:36:54,144 --> 00:37:00,288
DMT 6.23 and the NZ office of local intersection

367
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Funky spex

368
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:06,688
The meeting room Gap the meeting room sorry

369
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Easter

370
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,464
Ups

371
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:25,120
OK anyway I'm finally it so you are encouraged to do the FPS because you're free

372
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,520
Feedback is really important for us that can help us to improve our tea tree

373
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm sorry if you suck you and if you have any questions you can ask

374
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
Yes

375
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:57,632
What is the address of sensitive information you say how does it find it

376
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:15,296
Not quite following the question you're saying is the truth security flaw the fact that you know where securedata is

377
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,000
The fact that you can use the address to look it up yes that is the true security flaw so

378
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:30,656
You can you can guess where secure data is stored but it's really hard big is a gigabyte

379
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
So unless you understand the code which you know it's looking

380
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:43,456
Speak to one help you much

381
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
By examining source code operating system then it sort of public fairly often where it stores things

382
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:57,536
Then you can read stuff you're not supposed to be able to read that's the real weakness a real strength inspector the real security weakness

383
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:07,008
After the lecture question

384
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,360
Yes

385
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:25,696
It's all relevant

386
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
It's not it's not a whole lot of time studying

387
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:38,496
The main reason for having waisake particular 2

388
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,568
For the second project so

389
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
It's important to note the basic ideas that exist and a useful and suchlike

390
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,368
Where do you click within the wireshark Windows 10 and such and such

391
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,720
Are the questions

392
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:20,736
Bgp doesn't advertise internal things yes

393
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:27,648
No no it doesn't advertise paid for them never ever Advertiser

394
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:28,928
Internal parts

395
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:35,328
Bgp is all about the next day

396
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:40,960
Compare how the ISS get the data from one end of themselves to the other end of themselves

397
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:45,056
That information is never never said

398
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
You never tell anybody else to pass through yourself all I know is

399
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
If you're connected to know Isa and ASB an essay is your customer

400
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,792
Daniel to tell ASB how to get to SA

401
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
Is that right

402
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:22,432
During customer I suppose you would because

403
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,832
That's actually getting paid for

404
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:34,720
Is it connected to your customer

405
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
You tell

406
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:41,888
How to get to a you tell everybody how to get away because you get paid for traffic goes to and from a

407
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:49,056
How to get to Beacon how to get to C

408
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,848
The other one through yourself

409
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:55,967
Because if you carry date of for them that you acting as a Transit ISP

410
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,831
You're not getting paid for that all so you wouldn't think they cost

411
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,391
The question

412
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,511
I beg your pardon

413
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:14,399
Can you read out the connections that would turn someone into a customer

414
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,191
Other questions

415
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
Question about part 1 questions about the structure of the exam questions about ideal study

416
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,015
Christian resources

417
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
Still got 10 minutes

418
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,767
10 minutes 149 by Mum watch

419
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:46,911
Computer ok with between 6 and 10 minutes question

420
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:59,455
Yes yes you need to actually email Eliza

421
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,295
40 Tales of the algorithm smoothie understand how they work

422
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,439
Yes

423
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:25,567
So like I said they no longer answer questions there's nothing we are expected to write a big chunk of code

424
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:30,687
Like I said what are the steps to setting up a socket

425
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:37,087
Respect that you would be able to tell us what system call is required for this so

426
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:43,487
Yes that sort of coding is assessable but you don't have to write a big a big thing to download a file or something

427
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:51,423
Just see for the subject

428
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,775
Yes

429
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Yes

430
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:24,959
I will probably answer the letter just know what the basic things that need to be done

431
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,151
You need to do

432
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:38,783
I've got one other

433
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:45,183
Announcement / apology when I was reading through some of the things with things that I have been going to talk about

434
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:51,583
So I will upload a new version of this

435
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:56,191
Same thing as we didn't really cover the slides

436
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,399
So what was the example you gave

437
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:31,263
Creepy clock speed

438
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,687
That wasn't zone greatly in the lecture it was

439
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:45,087
Play more study more in the tutorial so yes I would expect that you would know the level of detail that was covered in the

440
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:51,487
Tutorial

441
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,887
That wireshark wireshark lab it was also something about

442
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:03,007
I think

443
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:09,407
That stuff is acceptable I won't be asking about killer but the actual networking

444
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:12,991
Contents

445
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:41,407
The final slides

446
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:44,735
Fine then

447
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:51,135
Nothing I said

448
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
Question

449
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:09,055
Nat and subnet

450
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:14,943
Very different is region of the address space

451
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:18,271
Been allocated to a network

452
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:23,903
So have a network master has more one Dixon it essentially

453
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:26,719
Matt is

454
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:29,535
Original

455
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:35,935
I'm not part of the network address is just one address that's too

456
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,983
Complete network

457
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:50,527
True of most of the material in those few lectures not really related at all

458
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,927
How many people would like a long explanation of how many people think they understand the difference between

459
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:01,279
Almond something

460
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:04,351
How many people think that I don't quite understand

461
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
Ok so

462
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:20,991
Nat is expanding

463
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:22,527
Address

464
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,927
Find a single address

465
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,559
Where is a network

466
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:40,959
State of address

467
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:47,359
3.0 binary tree

468
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:52,991
Going down is one of those trees

469
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:04,255
Pretend tree

470
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
Is actually a whole bunch of

471
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:16,031
It's like

472
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:22,431
Maps to whole network behind the portal

473
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:28,319
Answer the question

474
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
Annette

475
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:48,543
That is really a process translation so with that

476
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:54,943
Network has

477
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,343
Location

478
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:08,511
What's on the other side difference

479
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:12,607
Communicate with

480
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:21,055
So you can compete with the public Network at all but when you want to go

481
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:31,295
And that will do the translation of the address in the port and everything all look like a single Point

482
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Does doing a lot of stuff

483
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
Inside we're just a whole lot of individuals

484
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
Time for half a question

485
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,423
Yes

486
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:54,079
Do you need to know any specific my crops no you don't you need to know the concept of

487
00:50:54,335 --> 00:51:00,479
Realise

488
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:06,879
But different machines have different

489
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:13,279
Ok that's all the time for

490
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:19,679
Back and good luck
